# Cmus notify: automated portable script that get's the current
# song's file name, without caring about it's location, since
# many scrpits only work if the songs are in ~/music

# Functionalities migth be added in the future

current () {
  # Display the current song (File name), this method:
  # - Looks the directory of the currently playing song with cmus satus and regex to get the length
  # - Sums 5 to the length (because cmus status prints "file " and we don't want that)
  # - Gets the song cmus status
  # - Only filters the line with the full directory
  # - Cuts the previously calculated sum to only leave the file name
